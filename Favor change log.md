# Favors
These changes made will allow us to structure and moderate Carousing downtimes as well as create a tangible way to progress with downtimes other than the xp given and gold given out. This also allows us as DMs to have weight with the favors given out as they can actually affect the game more with this change. Numbers and percentages for rewards and discounts will be discussed if this is allowed to be used. 

Favors no longer subscribe to a single city and may be used outside the city it was gained in at the "Out of Category Bonus" modifier amount. If the favor is used in the same city under the same category only then will a player recive the full bonus for the class of the Favor.

To keep track of a Favor given out use this outline.
```
Player:
Character:
Favor: <City> <Class> <Category>
DM:
```
 
As an example:
```
Player: Legion 
Character: Ember 
Favor: Ahms Lower Crime
DM: Legion
```

## Class of Favors
Class of Favor corresponds to the amount of gold a player spends on the Carousing; Lower (5gp), Middle (25gp), and Upper (125gp) respectively will give bonuses to downtime rolls as represented below. These classes don't determine the actual wealth of the person that gave the Favor, just the amount of gold a player used to Carouse with.
Class | Bonus to Rolls | Out of Category Bonus
:--: | :--: | :--: 
Upper | +5 | +3
Middle | +3 | +1
Lower | +1 | +0

## Category of Favors
Instead of giving a Favor regarding a single downtime, a DM can choose what "Category" of Favor a player gets for their downtime. The seven categories below outline what each Favor can do. More than one catagory can be given out for a successful Carousing Downtime. 
Category | Cost of 6 Favors | Cost of 4 Favors | Cost of 1 Favor | Special
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
Reputation | Guild Backing | - | Recruit a Trainer | Use 2 to get out of any consquence from a downtime
Monetary | Guild Backing; "Merchant" Reputation Point | Coin Reward; Caravan | Double Rewards for: Gambling, Work, Religious Service Downtimes | -
Work | Guild Backing; "Work Horse" Reputation Point | - | Double Rewards for: Work Downtimes; Reduce Cost of Crafting Mundane item; Reduce Cost of Crafting Sessions for Magic Items | -  
Commision | "Artist" Reputation Point | Art Show | Double Rewards for: Work, Gambling Downtimes | -
Talent | "Talented" Reputation Point | Special Job | Double Rewards for: Work, Bounty Hunting, Pit Fighting Downtimes | - 
Crime | "Criminal" Reputation Point | Hiest | Double Rewards for: Crime, Bounty Hunting Downtimes | - 
Research | "Scholar" Reputation Point | Research Expedition | Reduce Cost of Researching Downtime | - 

With this players can use any Favor on any downtime they wish. The "Out of Category Bonus" only applies if a player uses a Favor of a certain Category for a Downtime it does not gain benefits on.
Only one Favor may be used on any one Downtime. This bonus to rolls made stays until the downtime is completed and only works in downtime scenarios. 

In addition players may now buy additional things with their Favors they gained. The added "items" will be noted below:
Item | Effect
:--: | :--:
Guild Backing | (Work in Progress) In order to create a guild a player must gain a "Guild Backing" from three Categories: Those three being Work, Monetary, and Reputation. The Class of the Favor must be at least Middle in order to redeem a "Guild Backing".
Reputation Points | (Work in Progress) These points give players additional rewards for their categories and may allow more advanced downtimes to be done.
Special Jobs | These are the "Art Show", "Special Job", "Heist", and "Research Expedition" redeemable items. Each of these allow a player to do a "quest" but also takes two of their downtimes to complete. A DM can pick up these quests at their own leisure. 

Special Jobs:
- Art Show: In this a player may create an art show, showing off their gems, and art they have collected (Not magical items). During this art show NPCs will try to steal art from the show and get it out before the player can catch them. As a reward the player gets as much gold value as they put in the art show without having to actually sell the items.
- Special Job: This is a Hitman's job or a crews job. The person that initiated this job will get to choose a target to try to assassinate or capture. This target can be any NPC a DM has ran before and must only be an NPC. As a reward a player gets 3x the reward amount for bounty hunts done for the next 5 bounty hunts.
- Heist: Straight forward a player or crew are trying to infiltrate an area and get coin and other items out. Player reward varies. 
- Research Expedition: Players can form an expedition group that goes and find the materials for three recipes of their choosing. On this expedition if successful the player will gain enough crafting materials to make at least one of the three items.
- Caravan: A player may gather a caravan of merchants and other people to travel to a city with. During this time bandits and monsters may come attack the caravan. Rewards: Carousing costs reduced for the next five Carousings done within the city the Caravan went to. 
- More to come!
